_I have used HTML, CSS and Bootstrap Framework to build this and the website._

## UX

A responsive website for a **fictional** man who lives in San Diego, United States.     
Website features resume, downloadable Curriculum Vitea, progress bar and contact form.
The primary goal of the website is to lead potential customers, jobs and improving myself. 

The business goals of this website:
*   Provide informations of Mr Joe Black
*   UX design keeps potential clients, customers on site
*   Getting more deals

The clients goals of this website:
*   Searching for new websites
*   Searching for new developers
*   Searching for new ideas


#### Wireframe mockups:

The wireframes for the initial layout of the website I drawn by hand and can be located here. [here](https://github.com/kompeet/first-milestone-project/tree/master/wireframes)
When designing the initial layout of the website I provided a sketch for how I picutred the website to look on both large screens such as desktops  
and how it would look on small screens such as a mobile phone.


#### Design Choices 

* For the main website content I decided on a shades of black and white for the color scheme. 
The rational for choosing two shades of yellow and orange which aids in highlighting the content within it.
* The buttons were primarily based on Bootstraps btn class however; the color scheme of the button, fonts, 
and hover have been adjusted to compliment the website color scheme.
